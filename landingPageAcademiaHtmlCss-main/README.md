This HTML landing page code is designed for beginners to create a simple and visually appealing webpage for an international Edutech agency. The code includes a header with a dynamic background, a navigation bar with stylish links, and a registration button. The main section displays the agency's name, a slogan, and a call-to-action button for booking trips. However, there's a small issue in the CSS related to the button styling that beginners need to address for proper display.
